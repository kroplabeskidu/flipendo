# Lighting

How KnowWonder's renderer lights meshes (characters and props) and BSP light maps, reversed from HP1's Render.dll
(addresses are HP1's). Mesh lighting is ported in `src/knowwonder/KWMeshLight.cpp`, used by `KW::DrawSkeletalMesh`
(`src/knowwonder/Anim/KWSkeletal.cpp`); light maps in `src/knowwonder/KWLightmap.cpp`, hooked into SurrealEngine's `LightmapBuilder` (see
"Light maps" at the end). KnowWonder added `Actor.LightSource` (`LD_Point`, `LD_Plane` = parallel light, `LD_Ambient` =
all directions) and `LightRadiusInner` to UE1's light properties; outdoor maps light with them (HP1's Lev2_Quid1: two
`LD_Plane` suns, brightness 80, radius 255, LightRadiusInner 255).

**HP1 and HP2.** HP2's `Actor.uc` declares the same `LightSource` and `LightRadiusInner`, and `FGetHSV` (Engine.dll) is
identical ([hp2_compare.md](../reports/hp2_compare.md)). The rest lives in Render.dll, which has no HP2 fingerprint yet,
so whether HP2's renderer lights the same way is not checked. The map statistics at the end are HP1's.

# Mesh lighting

## Drawing (URender::DrawLodMesh, Render.dll 0x10B0FF00)

- Vertex normals: the sum of the face normals of every face using the vertex, normalized as `n / sqrt(|n|² + 0.001)`
  (normals that cancel stay near zero; there is no fallback direction). `bMeshCurvy`: the normal points from the
  actor's location to the vertex instead.
- Faces are back-face culled unless their material is `PF_TwoSided`. The test runs in view space: with face vertices
  P0, P1, P2 it computes `n = (P0-P1) x (P2-P0)` and draws the face when `(n . P0) * Mirror < 0` (the scene node's
  Mirror, -1 in mirror reflections, which also swaps the drawing order). View axes (X right, Y down, Z forward) are a
  reflection of world axes (X forward, Y right, Z up), which turns the cross product around: in world space the
  drawn faces are those whose `(P1-P0) x (P2-P0)` points at the viewer, and the vertex normals are sums of that same
  vector. Getting this backwards draws the inside of every closed mesh (faces seen through the backs of heads) and
  lights characters from the wrong side. Thin props are built as two coplanar quads, one
  per side (the classroom `TransBlackboard`: vertices 0-3 front, 4-7 back). Without the cull they z-fight triangle by
  triangle, which looks like a diagonal split between two differently lit halves.
- `PF_Unlit` faces get a flat grey: `clamp(AmbientGlow/256 + ScaleGlow/2, 0, 1)`. Zone 0 is not unlit; an actor
  outside the BSP (`Region.iLeaf == -1`) gets ambient only.
- D3DDrv draws the vertex light as a plain modulation of the texture (light × 255 as the vertex colour), so the
  values below are what ends up on screen. SurrealEngine's own mesh light multiplied by 3 before clamping.

## Picking lights (the light manager's SetupForActor, sub_10B098F0)

GLightManager's vtable is `off_10B386D4` (+8 SetupForActor, +24 Light per vertex).

- Nothing for `bUnlit` actors or actors outside the BSP.
- Candidates: the lights picked for this actor last time (a per-actor cache of up to 16 lights with a fade byte), the
  lights permeating its BSP leaf, the dynamic lights touching it. A candidate needs `LightType != LT_None`,
  `LightBrightness != 0`, the same `bSpecialLit` as the actor, and the actor's location inside its radius.
  Coronas are not excluded.
- Importance `(1 - dist/radius) * LightBrightness * 1024`, sorted strongest first. Picked: at most 3 static lights;
  dynamic lights only while fewer than 3 lights are picked in total; nothing under 1/8 of the first picked light.
- A light must see the actor's location: `UModel::LineCheck` on the level's own model (vtable +92, zero extent, light →
  actor), so movers and other actors never block a light. The check runs again only every 16 frames per
  light (staggered by the light's object index); in between the last result is kept. Dynamic `bMovable` lights skip it.
- Fade: 768 per second. Picked lights fade in, dropped ones fade out and keep lighting until they reach 0. An actor
  seen for the first time gets its visible lights at full strength at once.

## A light's colour (sub_10B06920, URender::GlobalLighting 0x10B06810)

- Colour `FGetHSV(LightHue, LightSaturation, 255)` (Engine.dll 0x10420DD0; not SurrealEngine's lightmap `hsbtorgb`),
  times `LightBrightness/255` changed by the LightType (table at 0x10B38288: Pulse `0.6 + 0.39 sin`, SubtlePulse
  `0.9 + 0.09 sin`, phase `Level.TimeSeconds * 2293760 / LightPeriod + LightPhase * 256` with 65536 per turn; Blink,
  Flicker from a per-frame random table, Strobe toggling every frame, TexturePalette* from the Skin's palette),
  clamped to 0..1, times `LevelInfo.Brightness` and the fade. `bDarkLight` negates it.
- Falloff is linear: `min((radius - dist) / (radius - radius * LightRadiusInner / 256), 1)`. `LightRadiusInner` is a
  KnowWonder property. It isn't clamped at 0, so vertices past the radius lose light.

## A vertex's light (the light manager's Light, sub_10B02B10)

- Ambient: `2 * ScaleGlow * FGetHSV(zone AmbientHue, AmbientSaturation, AmbientBrightness) + AmbientGlow/255`
  (AmbientGlow 255 pulses `0.25 + 0.2 sin(8t)`).
- Per light: `cos` = `L·N / |L|` (LD_Point), `N·direction` (LD_Plane), 1 (LD_Ambient). Diffuse `max(2 * ScaleGlow * cos, 0)`;
  with ScaleGlow 0.7 the cosine is bent to `(cos + 1)² - 1.5`.
- Specular, on by default (SpecularGlow 1, SpecularWidth 170): `cutoff = (1 - SpecularWidth/170)²`,
  `strength = 2 * SpecularGlow / (1 - cutoff)²` (6 with ScaleGlow 0.7). With R = L reflected about the normal and V
  the eye → vertex vector, `strength * ((R·V)² / (|L|²|V|²) - cutoff)` is added when R·V > 0 and the term is positive.
- Added as `colour * falloff * (diffuse + specular)` when that sum is positive. Each channel is then clamped to 1 with
  an unsigned compare, so a negative channel also becomes 1.
- The original lights in camera space but takes LD_Plane's direction in world space; we light in world space.

# Light maps

The light manager's light map builder is `sub_10B077F0` (Render.dll). It fills the map with the zone ambient, sets up
each light with `sub_10B06920` (the same light info as for meshes, 49 dwords), runs the light's LightEffect function
from the table at `off_10B38110` (3 dwords per effect: function + two flags) on the light's shadow bytes, and merges
the result into the map with `sub_10B03430`. SurrealEngine keeps the light picking, shadow maps and caching; KnowWonder's
terms replace its falloff, colour scale and ambient.

## Which lights a surface gets

`sub_10B077F0` is slot 3 of the light manager's vtable (0x10B386E0; slot 2 is SetupForActor, `sub_10B098F0`). It
asks the level's brush tracker whether the surface belongs to a mover (`Surf.Actor`), then:

- **A mover with `bDynamicLightMover`** (AMover+720 bit 4): every light in the permeating list of the BSP leaf the mover
  is in (`Region.iLeaf`, AActor+164 → `Leaves[iLeaf].iPermeating` → `Model.Lights`, null-terminated) whose location is
  in front of the surface's plane and whose `bSpecialLit` (AActor+496 bit 0) matches the mover's, with no shadow; then
  the surface's dynamic lights and volumetric lights. Nothing if the mover's leaf is -1: when Lev_Tut1b's portcullis
  rises into the wall its pivot enters solid space and the bars go black on the way up (the original does the same). Ported in
  `KW::DynamicMoverLights` (`src/knowwonder/KWLightmap.cpp`). SurrealEngine instead used the lights with a clear line to the
  mover's pivot, which for Lev_Tut1b's portcullis (`Mover15`, pivot inside the door frame) was none: dropped, it
  showed as black with a faint blue zone ambient.
  The leaf is the one SetActorZone found. HP1's LoadMap (0x1039C3D0) calls `SetActorZone(actor, 1, 1)` for every
  loaded actor between BeginPlay and PostBeginPlay; SurrealEngine kept the Region saved in the map, which for movers is
  leaf -1, so a bDynamicLightMover had no lights until it first moved: Lev_Tut1b's turning bridge (`Mover2`,
  FlipBridge1) was dim before it turned (`KW::SetStartupZones`).
- **Any other surface**: the light map's own light list (`LightActors`, from the editor's light build, with its shadow
  bits) plus the dynamic lights.

The leaf in `Region` comes from `UModel::PointRegion` (Engine.dll 0x1042C2A0): walking the BSP, a point in front of a
node's plane takes `iLeaf[1]` and `iZone[1]`, behind it `iLeaf[0]` and `iZone[0]`. SurrealEngine's `FindRegion` paired
the front zone with the back leaf, so actors often had leaf -1 (fixed for every game, `src/surreal-patches/0010-engine-fixes.patch`).

- **Where the lumels are**: `sub_10B06920` takes `FCoords::Inverse` of the surface's map coords (origin `pBase`, X =
  TextureU, Y = TextureV, Z = normal) and uses its columns, times UScale/VScale, as the world step per lumel. Lumels
  therefore lie on the surface plane even when U and V don't (a projected texture). SurrealEngine stepped along U and V
  themselves: on Lev_Tut1b's slanted fan-vault panels (`Ceiling_lev1`, Flipendo challenge room) the lumels sat ~400
  units above the surface, out of reach of every light, and the vault was black instead of lit (fixed in
  `LightmapBuilder::CalcWorldLocations`, ungated: stock UE1 places lumels the same way).
- **Which zone's ambient**: the light map builder (`sub_10B077F0`) takes the ambient from the zone in the renderer's
  surface info (`FSurfaceInfo` +52; AmbientBrightness/Hue/Saturation at AZoneInfo +720/+721/+722), the zone on the
  viewer's side of the surface: for a wall seen from the front that's the node's front zone, `iZone[1]`. SurrealEngine
  passed the opposite side (its `Front` flag was true when the camera was behind the plane), so walls took the solid
  side's zone 0 (LevelInfo, usually no ambient). Lev_Tut2's courtyard facades lost ZoneInfo0's blue ambient
  (brightness 50) and were nearly black (fixed 2026-10-05, ungated, `Render/VisibleFrame.cpp`). The Lev_Tut1 intro
  Before that fix the Lev_Tut1 intro calibration (below) had been measured with the wrong zone's ambient.
- **Light map values** are 7 bits per channel, 127 = full. The ambient fill is `floor(FGetHSV(zone ambient) * 64)`
  (`0.25 * 256`), alpha 127. Each light adds `min(colour * L, 127)` per channel through a 256-entry palette (L = the
  lumel byte, 0..255; colour = `GlobalLighting` colour × brightness after LightType × `LevelInfo.Brightness`), with a
  7-bit saturating add (bDarkLight lights subtract, stopping at 0). So one light can reach full on its own at L ≥ 127.
- **On screen**: D3DDrv's RGBA7 upload doubles every byte (`sub_100022C0`, `*dst = 2 * src`) and the light map stage
  is `D3DTOP_MODULATE2X` (`SetBlending`; the multipass fallback is DESTCOLOR × SRCCOLOR, also 2x). 127 is therefore
  about 2x the texture, the same range as SurrealEngine's shader (light map × 2): a KnowWonder byte b = SurrealEngine
  `2b/255`. SurrealEngine's own builder adds `illum * colour` (half of KnowWonder's) and fills ambient with the full HSV colour.
- **Measured against the original** (2026-10-04): the terms above made every level about 2x too bright. Same frame of
  the Lev_Tut1 intro (the wide staircase shot, 640x480, Brightness 0.4 in both), luminance percentiles 10/25/50/75/90
  of the original 19/34/63/98/139, ours 37/67/120/180/217; halving the lights and the ambient fill gave 19/35/64/97/136.
  Keeping the cap at 127 (2x the texture) matters: with it lowered to 1x the top 10% stayed dark (121 vs 139).
  **Remeasured 2026-10-05** after the zone fix, against frames of the original captured with `tools/orig_shots.ps1`
  (windowed D3D, Brightness 0.4) and paired by content. Lev_Tut1's zones have almost no ambient (brightness 5), so its
  frames hardly depend on it (whole frame ours/original 0.97 halved, 1.03 full). Lev_Tut2's courtyard is lit almost
  only by ZoneInfo0's ambient (brightness 50): its shaded walls came out 0.67-0.85 of the original with the ambient
  halved and 0.97-1.01 with it as reversed. So only the lights are halved (`MeasuredScale` in
  `src/knowwonder/KWLightmap.cpp`, a factor 2 missed somewhere in the palette, the upload or the blend, not found in
  Render.dll / D3DDrv.dll yet); the ambient fill is exactly the formula above. Results: Lev_Tut2 intro 8/22/38/64/93
  vs the original's 9/23/38/64/95; Lev_Tut1 21/39/70/102/140 vs 19/35/63/97/139 (the original's own neighbouring
  frames vary by ±5). The original also shows bright patches on the paving under Harry and Hooch in Lev_Tut2 (their
  broom shadows; possibly how its D3DDrv draws on Windows 11, not checked).
- **The lumel byte**, LE_None (`loc_10B037C0`; with a LightRadiusInner it runs `sub_10B0CA70`, the same plus a clamp):
  `L = shadow * min(k * table[m], 1)`, 0 outside the radius, where
  - `m = floor((d / R * 4095)² / 4096)` (d = lumel to light, R = `WorldLightRadius`), `table[m]` at
    `t = sqrt((m + 1) / 4096)` is `2t³ - 3t² + 1` (smoothstep falloff), divided by t for `LD_Point`
    (tables `flt_10B5B684` / `flt_10B43320`, built in `sub_10B023A0`);
  - `k = incidence * R / (R - inner)`, inner = `LightRadiusInner * R / 256`. LightRadiusInner doesn't change the
    falloff's shape, it scales it up and the clamp keeps it full near the light (255 makes the light saturate almost to
    its radius);
  - incidence: `LD_Point` `|light - surface plane| / R` (times table/t this is the cosine: `cos * f(t)`; SurrealEngine
    computed `cos * f(t) / t`), `LD_Plane` `max(-X · N, 0)` with X the light's (a pawn's: view) rotation axis,
    `LD_Ambient` 1. Plane and ambient lights still fall off with distance from the light actor.
- **The radius**: KnowWonder's `AActor::WorldLightRadius` (Engine.dll 0x1031BA10) is `max(DrawScale, 1) * (LightRadius + 1) * 25`
  (SurrealEngine leaves out DrawScale). It's R everywhere: light maps, the mesh light picking and falloff. Lev2_Quid1's
  suns have DrawScale 5 (R = 32000); without it they barely reached the pitch. `WorldVolumetricRadius` has no DrawScale.
- **LE_NonIncidence** (`sub_10B05DC0`): `shadow * min(R / (R - inner) * smoothstep[floor(d² * 4093 / R²)], 1)`, no
  incidence and no LightSource.
- **LE_TorchWaver/FireWaver/WateryShimmer** run LE_None; `sub_10B03430` then scales the lumels by `0.95 + 0.05 r`,
  `0.8 + 0.2 r`, `0.6 + 0.4 r` (r from a random table, every frame) as it merges them. The flicker isn't ported.
- Not ported: the other effects (Searchlight, SlowWave, FastWave, StaticSpot, Spotlight, Interference, Cylinder: ~60
  lights in all of HP1's maps) still use SurrealEngine's functions, only the colour and clamps are KnowWonder's. Of the
  ~11,900 lights in HP1's maps, LE_None has ~10,700 and NonIncidence ~1,060; LD_Ambient ~310, LD_Plane ~20.
